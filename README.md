# A-three-multilevel-model-with-lme4
This repository is for the EpiAnalytic Webinar demonstrating how to code with "lme4" package for a-three multilevel modelling

## Overview
This repository contains the data and code for a-three multilevel modelling on clinical decision-making among registered nurses in clinical practice. This project aims to identify and explore factors influencing the CDM from individual level, hospital level, and the regional level.


## Code

The R folder contains the R scripts used to conduct the multilevel analysis and generate the figures and tables.

## Results

The key findings of the study are summarized in the following:

The results of the three-level mixed-effects model revealed that the effect of critical thinking on CDM score varies across different regions. Also, there are significant associations between Clinical decision-making among registered nurses withÂ knowledge skills, critical thinking skills, experience, and hospital settings. There is also a significant cross-level interaction showing that the effect of experience on nurses's CDM scores depends on the hospital setting. 

## Reproducibility

To reproduce the analysis:
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/eidaadz/SRMA_CTCDM/tree/main

Install required packages:
install.packages(c("lme4", "lmertest","performance","reghelper"))

Run the R scripts: Execute the R scripts in the R folder sequentially.
